# Custom AutoCAD Macro Keypad


##  Overview
This project is a custom-built keypad designed specifically to streamline workflows in **AutoCAD**. By mapping complex command sequences and frequently used shortcuts to single keystrokes, this device significantly reduces hand movement and increases drafting efficiency.

##  Features
* **Dedicated Macro Keys:** One-touch execution for commands like `TRIM`, `ISOCIRCLE`, `CIRCLE`, and `DIMENSION`.
* **Media Control:** Dedicated buttons to skip or rewind background music tracks without alt-tabbing away from AutoCAD.
* **Ergonomic Layout:** Designed to sit next to the mouse for one-handed operation.
* **Plug & Play:** Functions as a standard HID keyboard (no special drivers required on the host PC).


##  Hardware used
* STM32F103C8T6
* Pushbuttons
